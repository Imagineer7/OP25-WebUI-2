multi_rx.py now supports a simple narrowband fm analog demodulator.  It piggybacks alongside the regular digital
voice channel object defined in cfg.json and can either be controled by trunking (e.g. for Smartnet monitoring)
or turned on and used as a stand-alone nbfm receiver.

    "channels": [
        {
            "name": "voice channel", 
            "device": "rtl1",
            "destination": "udp://127.0.0.1:23456", 
            "frequency": 859000000,
            "enable_analog": "auto",
            "nbfm_deviation": 4000,
            "nbfm_squelch": -60,
            "demod_type": "fsk4", 
            "filter_type": "widepulse", 
            "excess_bw": 0.2, 
            "if_rate": 24000, 
            "symbol_rate": 4800,
            "plot": ""
        }

Parameters of relevance to the NBFM module are:
    enable_analog: "off","on" or "auto" - auto is the default for use with trunking
    nbfm_deviation: 4000                - deviation in Hz; will affect output volume
    nbfm_squelch:   -60                 - approx avg power (in dB) required to open squelch
