OP25 supports sending of metadata updates to an icecast streaming server.
Configuration depends on which variant of op25 you are running; rx.py or multi_rx.py

rx.py
-----
Make a local copy of meta.json (e.g. cp meta.json my_meta.json) and edit it so that it matches your
streaming server mount point and password

    {
        "icecastPass": "password",
        "icecastMountpoint": "mountpoint",
        "icecastServerAddress": "server.name:port",
        "delay": "0.0", "icecastMountExt": ".m3u",
        "meta_format_idle": "[idle]",
        "meta_format_tgid": "[%TGID%]",
        "meta_format_tag":  "[%TGID%] %TAG%"
    }

Add the "-M my_meta.json" command line option to rx.py


multi_rx.py
-----------
Metadata information is entered in the "metadata" section of the main cfg.json configuration file.
Format and content is the same as used by rx.py

Metatag Format
--------------
The user has some control over the format of the metadata presented to the streaming server. The following
pieces of information are available:
    %TGID% - numeric talkgroup id
    %TAG%  - descriptive talkgroup string (from tgid-tags.tsv file)

By modifying the content of the meta_format_* parameters you can customize the text for the three typical
use cases.
    meta_format_idle - sent when op25 is idle/waiting for a call
    meta_format_tgid - sent during a call when only the tgid is known
    meta_format_tag  - sent during a call when both tgid and tag are known
%TGID% and %TAG% will be substituted with the in-call data at runtime
