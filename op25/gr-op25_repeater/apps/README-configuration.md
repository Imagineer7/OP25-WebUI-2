The following steps need to be taken by users wishing to configure OP25 to
monitor a P25 Trunked system.  More complex setups are supported, but this
is the base starting point.

All instructions below assume you are in the 'apps' directory.
	cd ~/op25/op25/gr-op25_repeater/apps

1. Set up the control channel frequencies in trunk.tsv
	./setTrunkFreq.sh 773.84375

   If you need multiple frequencies because your control channel moves around,
   place them in a comma separated list as follows (with no whitespace)
	./setTrunkFreq.sh 773.84375,774.19375

2. Use the startup script op25.sh to run the application (rx.py). This can be
   customized, but the defaults should be appropriate for most stand-alone
   systems.  If you need streaming or multiple instances you'll need to dig
   more deeply into the command line options for port numbers.
	./op25.sh

3. Once the application starts it will attempt to lock the control channel
   and make small tuning adjustments automatically. If you have an old sdr
   hardware that does not have a temp-compensated crytal oscillator (TXCO)
   you may need to adjust the ppm correction using the -q parameter in the
   op25.sh startup script.
